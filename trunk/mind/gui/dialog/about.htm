<p>The development of the software reMIND 
has been going on since 2000. The method that reMIND is based upon is the MIND 
method, which was developed in the early 1990’s at the division Energy Systems 
at Linköping university. Originally the MIND method was implemented in a 
Fortran-based software, simply called MIND. Due to several reasons the 
Fortran-based software needed to be replaced, which was enabled by the offspring 
reMIND.</p>
<p>The development has been going on in 
several rounds with the supervision of the division Energy Systems at Linköping 
university. At Energy Systems a group of people has been involved in e.g. 
creating requirements for functions, for the graphical interface and for the 
overall functioning of the software. This group consisted at the initial step of 
the following persons:</p>
<p>Ph.D <b>Magnus Karlsson<br>
</b>Ph.D <b>Peter Sandberg<br>
</b>Associate Prof.<b> Mats Söderström</b></p>
<p>Also, Ph.D <b>Mei Gong</b> participated 
to some degree in this work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The initial programming was performed by 
a student group at Linköping university building the graphical interface and 
implemented the basic functions for the software. This group started creating 
reMIND software in the beginning of 2001 and delivered the first version in May 
2001. The student group consisted of:</p>
<p><b>Peter Andersson</b><br>
<b>Martin Hagman<br>
Henrik Norin<br>
Anna Stjerneby<br>
Tim Terlegård<br>
Johan Trygg<br>
Peter Åstrand</b></p>
<p><b>Johan Trygg</b> 
and <b>Tim Terlegård</b> continued working on the software during the following 
summer including some additional functions to the software and corrected some 
errors.</p>
<p>After the initial work at Linköping 
university a group at Luleå technical university included two new functions 
(Flow Equation and BoundaryTOP) and corrected some errors. In this group Ph.D <b>
Mikael Larsson</b> formulated the requirements and <b>Urban Liljedahl</b> 
implemented the ideas in the software.</p>
<p>In late summer 2003 the software was 
updated once more, where a variety of changes were performed such as; errors 
were corrected, the graphical interface was improved, the structure of the 
software program was enhanced and the function of time steps was developed. At 
this stage <b>Magnus Karlsson </b>and <b>Peter Sandberg </b>at Linköping 
university constituted the group that formulated the requirements, while a 
consulting firm, ACE Simulation, implemented the requests. At ACE Simulation <b>
Jonas Sääv</b> and <b>Hans-Fredric Österlund</b> did the programming. <b>Peter 
Andersson</b>, from the student group, was used as support at the initial stage 
of this work, likewise was <b>Mats Söderström</b>.</p>
<p>A new student group was engaged to 
develop reMIND further during the autumn 2003 under the supervision of <b>Magnus 
Karlsson </b>and <b>Peter Sandberg</b> at Linköping university. In December 2003 
the group delivered an updated version of reMIND including a new function 
(Investment Cost) and this group consisted of:</p>
<p><b>Åsa Almstedt<br>
Manne Anliot<br>
Linus Fredriksson<br>
Mattias Gylin<br>
Mattias Sjölinder<br>
Johan Sjöstrand<br>
Anders Åkerlund</b></p>
<p>Thereafter, in spring 2004, the 
consulting firm ACE Simulation, mainly <b>Jonas Sääv</b>, implemented a couple 
of functions (batch, storage and logical equation) under the supervision of <b>
Magnus Karlsson </b>at Linköping university. <b>Peter Sandberg</b> assisted 
during this phase. Also, the consulting firm improved the structure of the 
software.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At the end of 2004 another student group 
delivered a new version of reMIND. This version included an automated routine 
for optimizing the problem at hand. The group consisted of the following 
persons:</p>
<p><b>Johan Bengtsson<br>
Daniel Campos<br>
Martin Fagerfjäll<br>
Daniel Ferm<br>
Able Mahari<br>
Andreas Remar<br>
Haider Shareef</b></p>
<p>In parallel, at Luleå technical 
university, the development of reMIND continued by including new functions in 
the software. This mainly included the opportunity for a multi-objective 
approach and the function editor. <b>Urban Liljedahl</b>, <b>Jan Sköllermark</b>,
<b>Nils-Oskar Spett</b>, <b>Rickard Harju</b> and <b>Marcus Bergendorff</b> 
implemented this in a local version at first, under the supervision of mainly <b>
Mikael Larsson</b> at Luleå technical university with the assistant of <b>Peter 
Sandberg </b>at Linköping university. In spring 2005 this was merged into reMIND 
by <b>Marcus Bergendorff</b>.</p>
<p>The next update was implemented by the 
consulting firm ACE Simulation, <b>Jonas Sääv</b>, in spring 2005. Based on the 
earlier implemented automatic routine, lp_solve was included as a possible 
optimizer as a complement to CPLEX, which was the only optimizer available 
before. Also, the time for creation of the MPS-file was reduced by changes 
within the code and some corrections of errors where made. During these changes
<b>Magnus Karlsson</b> acted as supervisor.</p>
<p>Ph.D student <b>Nawzad Mardan</b> was engaged to develop reMIND further during the summer 2007</p>

<p>

During the fall of 2007 a student group 
delivered a new version of reMIND, including support for exporting and importing
spreadsheets of the Excel 2003 XML format. <b>Magnus Karlsson</b> acted as supervisor.
The group consisted of:
